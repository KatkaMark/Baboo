                <p class="article__p__first--book"> 
                    The book ”Night Night My Baby Heart“ has been specially written to assist parents with their children’s going-to-sleep ritual. Each line of this original nursery rhyme is acccompanied by a two-page illustration. The lullaby describes what the child might see, hear and feel as they fall asleep.

                <p class="article__p__second--book">
                    Dreamy blue-and-white illustrations help to promote peace rather than excitement, while the transition from dark blue to light blue helps children overcome any possible fear of the dark.

                            <li>
                                Classic favourites like the moon, stars, dog, cat and bubbles help you to increase your child’s interest in baby-signs language.

                                The words are easy to remember, and thanks to the illustrations children are able to ’read‘ the book on their own. This not only supports their self-esteem, but also adds to their enjoyment of books.

                        Among the huge number of children's books these days, only a few really stand out - for their writing, illustrations, originality, world-view or emotional power. Books that in a few years will become collectors' items. I have no doubt that the lullaby 'Night Night My Baby Heart' by Lenka Bergmann Míkovcová is one of them. 

                        <p>This book is a real gem for small children. With each word the author takes her readers gently by the hand and leads them into a world of dreams. Lenka has the gift of talking to even the smallest children with a playful, tender and loving understanding of their world. Her rhythmical language produces a sense of calm before sleep, evoking feelings of intimacy and safety. She never uses rhyme for rhyme's sake; rather, she picks words that are meaningful to children, and avoids condescending &lsquo;baby-talk&rsquo;.</p>

                        <p>The profuse illustrations not only complement the words but act in their own way to convey the story, and the calming shades of blue are sensitively chosen to assist young readers on their voyage to dreamland. </p>

                        <p>'Night Night My Baby Heart' is a modern lullaby which totally understands the needs of small children. Its nursery rhymes are exactly the ones you would love your children to remember years later with affection, and those magical words: &ldquo;Do you remember how we used to fall asleep together?&rdquo;</p>

                        I love books, especially children’s books. I have been reading to both my daughters since they were small. And now I am starting to read to my son, even though he’s still very young. But that doesn’t matter, because Lenka’s book is perfect for sending him off to sleep. Little Damian loves the pictures (he has good taste!): they are a beautiful blue and with each ‘night night’ they turn into a lighter shade as your child approaches dreamland.
